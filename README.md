## Overview

**mark.md** is a web tool that allows users to extract clean and structured content from any website.  
It solves the problem of messy copy-paste using traditional methods (like **Ctrl + C**), where copied documentation often includes unwanted UI elements — especially on sites such as **Appwrite Docs** or **Supabase Docs**.

With **mark.md**, developers and AI workflows can quickly get clean **Markdown**, **HTML**, or **plain text** versions of any webpage, making documentation easier to **reuse**, **read**, and **process**.

- One-click export for developers and AI workflows  
- No installation or setup required — works directly in your browser

## Inspiration

Most documentation sites today don’t offer export options like **Markdown**, **HTML**, or **plain text**.  
Copying content manually is slow, inaccurate, and often breaks structure.

For both open-source and private projects, adding export support for every page is **time-consuming** and **hard to maintain**.  
And while the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** aims to make structured data accessible to LLMs, it’s not yet widely supported.

**mark.md** bridges this gap by offering a **universal, no-setup solution** — instantly converting any webpage into clean, developer-friendly formats.
