## Overview

**mark.md** is a web tool that allows users to extract clean and structured content from any website.  
It solves the problem of messy copy-paste using traditional methods (like **Ctrl + C**), where copied documentation often includes unwanted UI elements â€” especially on sites such as **Appwrite Docs** or **Supabase Docs**.

With **mark.md**, developers and AI workflows can quickly get clean **Markdown**, **HTML**, or **plain text** versions of any webpage, making documentation easier to **reuse**, **read**, and **process**.

---

## Features

- Extract **Markdown**, **HTML**, or **plain text** from any public webpage  
- Clean, clutter-free output (no navbars, ads, or sidebars)  
- One-click export for developers and AI workflows  
- No installation or setup required â€” works directly in your browser  
- Built for open-source and private documentation use cases  
- Hosted on **Appwrite Sites** and powered by **Vercel**

## Inspiration

Most documentation sites today donâ€™t offer export options like **Markdown**, **HTML**, or **plain text**.  
Copying content manually is slow, inaccurate, and often breaks structure.

For both open-source and private projects, adding export support for every page is **time-consuming** and **hard to maintain**.  
And while the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** aims to make structured data accessible to LLMs, itâ€™s not yet widely supported.

**mark.md** bridges this gap by offering a **universal, no-setup solution** â€” instantly converting any webpage into clean, developer-friendly formats.
